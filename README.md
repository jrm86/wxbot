# WXBOT Weather Discord Bot

Get a weather forecast from Discord. This is a work in progress and
something I'm just doing for fun. Code is messy and things will change
(often).

Invoke WXBOT by typing 'wx#####', where ##### is a 5-digit zip code.

WXBOT uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to
provide a very rudimentary text-only forecast. Future plans are to
build a more aesthetically pleasing forecast (icons/images for particular
types of weather, etc).
